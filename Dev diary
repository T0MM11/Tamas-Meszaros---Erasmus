# Tamas-Meszaros---Erasmus
My project for Manuel

Day 1.)
Today I planned the design of my website and I started to write the code of it. My website will be a website of an imaginary gamer café, named "Co-op Café".
The main colours are brownis-yellow and white. I used ChatGPT to write the texts on the webpage. As for the pictures I download some from the internet and I made one with DALL-E 2 AI.
My plane for tomorrow is finishing my website and maybe make better design on it.
